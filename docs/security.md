# Security

The sandbox is treated as hostile and your PC as precious.

## Containment

- The agent writes only your project folder and its own storage.
- Drive roots, your user profile, system folders and this tool's folders are refused as workspaces.
- Your LAN is blocked from inside the sandbox (DNS excepted). `sandbox.networking: false` cuts all network access.
- vGPU is off by default.

## Secrets

Before anything from your Claude settings is copied in, these are stripped:

- `settings.json` `env`
- credential helpers (`apiKeyHelper`, `awsCredentialExport` ...)
- every MCP server's env, headers, URL and arguments

Removed:

- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Cloudflare credentials, plus hosting, CI, registry, payment and AI API keys
- database URLs
- anything named `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `*PASSWORD*`, `*_KEY` or `*PROD*`
- values that look like keys, whatever they're called

`secrets.allow` lets named variables through, and `secrets.patterns` adds more to strip. A project file cannot weaken
these settings. The launch output lists what was kept back, and warns about files like `.env` or `*.pem` that the agent
can read because the whole folder is mapped.

## Nothing runs on your PC

- Host and sandbox talk through small JSON files. The sandbox can ask for four things (start a session, run a command,
  restart, ping), and everything it writes back is validated and size-capped.
- Text from the sandbox loses its escape sequences before it reaches your terminal.
- Links the sandbox plants are never followed.
- Files it writes are read with bounded effort.
- Attaching from your terminal connects only into the sandbox's Hyper-V network, with a per-session token.

## Downloads

Toolchain, database and tool downloads are checked against the SHA-256/SHA-512 their publisher lists, and a mismatch
deletes the file. Some sources list none (for example a script fetched from a vendor's site). By default those are
still allowed. Set `downloads.requireChecksum` to `true` to refuse any download that has no published checksum; the
failure names the file and the setting. A project's `.sandbox-config.json` can turn this on but never off. The
installer (`install.ps1`) similarly refuses a release package with no listed SHA-256 unless `WDS_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED=1`.

## Coming back

- Only data files return with history. claude-mem returns its database only.
- Git hooks and dangerous git config added inside the sandbox are quarantined before your own git can run them.
- So are executables planted in the project under names you type there (`node.exe`, `sandbox.cmd` ...).
- `sandbox status` lists anything that was quarantined.

## GitHub CLI

`gh` is never given your PC's login (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` are stripped) and is only installed with git access
`full`, because it can push and merge through the GitHub API. A login made inside is kept in `C:\AgentData\state\gh`.

`ssh` comes with Git, but no keys are copied in and your LAN is blocked, so deploys stay on your PC.

## Git access

`provisioning.git.access`, settable per project:

| | |
|---|---|
| `full` (default) | git as normal |
| `readonly` | status, log, diff, show, blame and listing branches/tags only |
| `none` | no git; the repository is invisible to it |

## Shared tools

`C:\AgentData` (tools and databases) is shared by every project's sandbox. For a repo you don't trust, give it its own
data set with `storage.dataName`.

Inside the disposable sandbox only, the "Do you want to run this file?", SmartScreen and firewall prompts are off.

Review what the agent writes like a contribution from a stranger.
